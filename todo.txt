x - github accounts for backend dev and frontend dev
- make issue-triage use a custom tool to enforce github token
- finish pr-fix
- finish pr-merge
- finish pr-conflicts

backlog
- have manager pick the agent for dev work (fix, conflict, issue triage)
- make custom tools fix, conflict, and merge
- add dispatch to each of these (use custom tool for this)
- error edge case, possible that one review fails and then the PR review step is all fucked up
    - should re-run review for that agent only
