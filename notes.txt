- had this whole thing working with 500+ prompts but some things were hardcoded
	- it did work end to end but was overly complex
	- would have been hard to generalize those hard coded parts

- migrating code is hard. might be better to start anew

- I like this pattern of custom tools that recieve a "state" input
	- get_open_prs("needs_review")
	- get_open_prs("needs_fix")
	- etc

- I like pattern of using custom tools to enforce identity and tracking (middleware)
	- enforce github token
	- enforce save to database
	- etc

- Easy to fall into trap of making too many things agentic

- Don't fall into trap of trying to one-shot really complex things
	- One shot fundamental building blocks
	- Build a solid foundation
	- Then go to the moon

- I like this pattern of testing it live, seeing a failure state, saving the state in testing fixtures (.json or whatever) and then having tests capture the failure mode and then having claude fix it
